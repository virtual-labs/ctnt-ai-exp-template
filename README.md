# CTNT AI Experiment Template

This repository provides a **starter template** for creating AI-enhanced Virtual Labs experiments.  
It includes ready-to-use structures and scripts to help you quickly set up experiments with good practices.

## What’s Inside

- **Experiment Templates** – Base files and structure for organizing content, pedagogy, and simulations.
    - [template 1](https://github.com/virtual-labs/ctnt-ai-exp-template/tree/main/template%201)
    - [template 2](https://github.com/virtual-labs/ctnt-ai-exp-template/tree/main/template%202)
    - [template 3](https://github.com/virtual-labs/ctnt-ai-exp-template/tree/main/template%203)
- **Mobile Detection Script** – A lightweight utility to detect if the user is on mobile, so layouts and interactions can adapt accordingly. [Here](https://github.com/virtual-labs/ctnt-ai-exp-template/blob/main/mobile-detection.js) is the script that you might want to use with your codebase.
- **Starter Guide** – Step-by-step instructions for getting started with creating and customizing experiments. [Click here](https://github.com/virtual-labs/ctnt-ai-exp-template/blob/main/ai-enhanced-virtual-experiment-creation-process.md) to get started.
